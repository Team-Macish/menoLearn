    <div  id="tab1">
      <h1 class="tabheader">Myth: Swimming in the ocean on your period will get you eaten by sharks.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">Okay, I will totally admit that I’m scared to death of sharks. But that has nothing to do with my period and a lot more to do with the movie “Jaws.” There has never been a documented case of a shark attacking a swimmer because she was menstruating. So, go ahead, dive in and have fun.</p>
    </div>
    <div  id="tab2">
      <h1>Myth: You shouldn’t wash your hair during your period.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">Thank goodness this is a myth, since I can’t imagine giving up my daily shower, especially during my period. There’s no reason for you to change any of your regular grooming and hygiene habits just because you’re having your period. In fact, a warm bath or shower will help you stay clean, and some girls say it helps with their cramps, too.</p>
    </div>
    <div  id="tab3">
      <h1>Myth: Bed rest is a must during your period.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">Sure, you should get plenty of sleep during your period, but you should always get plenty of exercise, too. You’ll feel better if you get up and get out there (especially since exercise has been shown to alleviate cramps and brighten your mood)!</p>
    </div>
    <div  id="tab4">
      <h1>Myth: Hot water increases period flow.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">The good news and the bad news: pretty much the only thing that will change your flow is your own body. So you can’t make it lighter (sorry!), and you can’t make it heavier. And a nice warm bath or shower, or a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel can help with cramps.</p>
    </div>
	<div  id="tab5">
      <h1>Myth: You shouldn’t use a tampon until you’re old enough.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">If you’re old enough to have your period, you’re old enough to use a tampon. Just read the instructions and warnings and be sure to use it correctly. It helps to ask your mom or another trusted adult for guidance. Tampons shouldn’t cause pain or discomfort.</p>
    </div>
	<div  id="tab6">
      <h1>Myth: Menstrual blood is different from regular blood.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">Menstrual blood is regular blood. This myth probably gained traction because menstrual blood flows from the vagina. And because vaginas are a normal part of the female body, there’s nothing unusual or wrong with menstrual blood. And did you know it has no odor? Now that’s a fact!</p>
    </div>
	<div  id="tab7">
      <h1>Myth: Women cannot water plants during their period because their “uncleanliness” will spoil the plant.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">I too am a cleanliness freak(I clean all the fans every two weeks), but this is on another level, even by my standards. There's absolutely no logic in this myth.</p>
    </div>
	<div  id="tab8">
      <h1>Myth: Women should not be in classrooms with other students while menstruating.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">If this were reality, then no standard would be able to finish their syllabus on time. Though it might mean holiday frenzy for students, but it's still an ill-founded myth.</p>
    </div>
	<div  id="tab9">
      <h1>Myth: Women should be put in isolation during their period, because they are "unclean.” , and will anger Hindu Goddesses.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">It might sound like vacation for women to you, but trust me, isolation's far worse than work. There's no reason a woman should be isolated during a period, and the "unclean theory" is as baseless as a cloud.</p>
    </div>
	<div  id="tab10">
      <h1>Myth: Women are not allowed to enter “clean” and holy places like temples.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">How was this myth even created ? Girls and women menstruating are not unclean. They are normal, natural, and healthy. In case you held up this myth as the correct thing, then you should write the previous sentence down.</p>
    </div>
	<div  id="tab11">
      <h1>Myth: Women cannot interact with or touch men because men will become sick by touching an “unclean” woman.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">As was the case with shark attacks, there hasn't been a documented case for this, either. So, don't worry, and go ahead !</p>
    </div>
	<div  id="tab12">
      <h1>Myth: In some cultures, women bury their cloths used during menstruation to prevent them being used by evil spirits.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">As if evil spirits existed, they don't have anything better to do than stealing buried cloth pads, to create some weird concoction that makes hair fall off, right ?<br>
To everyone who's able to read this, and thinking whether the myth is a reality(especially the part about evil spirits), c'mon. You're better than this.</p>
    </div>
	<div  id="tab13">
      <h1>Myth: In some parts of India,  sour food like curd, tamarind, and pickles are usually avoided by menstruating girls. It is believed that such foods will disturb or stop the menstrual flow.</h1>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">Seriously. There is no connection between menstrual cramps and eating sour foods.<br>However, it is essential for women to maintain a healthier diet during this period, so as to maintain proper nutrition during blood loss.</p>
    </div>
	<div  id="tab14">
      <h1>Myth: If a girl or woman touches a cow while she is on her period, that the cow will become infertile – leading girls to associate their own bodies with curse and impurity.</h2>
      <h4 style="font-weight: 300">It's not like the woman is the antagonist of a movie, who curses the things she touches. <br>She's just another human being, with no extraordinary abilities.Get your head out of comic books.</p style="text-center">
